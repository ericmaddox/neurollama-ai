This Python script enables an interactive chat with an AI that adjusts its responses based on the sentiment of the user's input. It uses text-to-speech (TTS) to speak the AI's responses and maintains conversation history in a file for continuity. The conversation history is saved, allowing the AI to recall memories from previous sessions and maintain context across interactions. The AI's responses are generated using **Ollama 3.2**, and sentiment analysis is performed with **TextBlob** to gauge the emotional tone of user input, allowing the AI to respond appropriately to frustration or positivity.

## Features

- **Text-to-Speech**: The AI's responses are read aloud using `pyttsx3`.
- **Conversation History**: The script keeps track of the last few exchanges for more context in responses.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: User input is analyzed for sentiment to guide the AI's tone in replies.
- **File Persistence**: Conversation history is saved to and loaded from a JSON file (`conversation_history.json`).
- **Customizable Configuration**: Configuration options like voice selection, interaction memory size, and timeout duration can be set in a `config.json` file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - `pyttsx3`
  - `subprocess`
  - `json`
  - `textblob`

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3 textblob
```

## Configuration

The script loads configuration from a `config.json` file. If the file is not found, default settings are used. The configuration file can specify the following settings:

```json
{
    "voice": "com.apple.voice.compact.en-US.Samantha",
    "history_file": "conversation_history.json",
    "interaction_memory": 10,
    "timeout": 30
}
```

- **voice**: The voice to use for text-to-speech (default: `com.apple.voice.compact.en-US.Samantha`).
- **history_file**: The file where conversation history is saved (default: `conversation_history.json`).
- **interaction_memory**: The number of past exchanges the AI remembers to use as context (default: `10`).
- **timeout**: Time in seconds to wait before considering the conversation as timed out (default: `30`).

## How It Works
1. **Initialization**: The script initializes the TTS engine (`pyttsx3`) and loads the configuration and conversation history.
2. **Chat Loop**:
   - The script prompts the user for input.
   - It analyzes the sentiment of the input using TextBlob.
   - If the sentiment is negative, the AI offers a reassuring response. If positive, the AI responds with encouragement. Otherwise, it generates a normal response using Ollama 3.2.
   - The conversation history is updated and saved after every interaction.
   - The AI’s response is printed to the console and spoken aloud using TTS.
3. **Exit**: The conversation can be ended by typing `exit`.

## Example

Chat with AI. Type 'exit' to end the conversation.

```plaintext
You: Hello, AI!
AI: I'm glad to hear your positivity! Let's continue.
You: I'm frustrated with this project.
AI: I sense some frustration. I'm here to assist you.
You: exit
```

## Notes
- **Ollama**: This script assumes you have the ollama CLI tool installed and accessible from the terminal. The AI’s responses are generated by running `ollama run llama3.2`. You can download Ollama from [here](https://ollama.com/download).
- **TextBlob**: The sentiment analysis uses TextBlob’s polarity, with values ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive).
